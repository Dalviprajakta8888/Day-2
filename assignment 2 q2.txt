                                 Assignment 2

Question 2 Explain with the example string and array method.

STRING METHOD -

 1) Slice = slice () extracts a part of string and return the extracted part in a new string.
            example = let str = "apple, banana, mango";
                      let res = str.slice(7,13); 

2) Substring method = it is similar to slice only differece is it cannot accept negative index.
                      Eg = let str = "apple, banana, mango";
                           let str = str.substring(7,13);

3) Replace method = The replace method replaces a speicified value with another value in the string
                    eg - str " please visit microsoft ";
                         var n = str.replace("microsoft", "dom");

4) Replace all = To replace all the matches use a regular expression with a /g flag .
                 eg -str ="please visit ms and ms";
                     var n = str.replace(/microsoft/g,"dom"); 

 ARRAY METHOD -  

1) Slicing an array - The slice method slices out a piece of an array into a new array. 
                        eg - var fruits = ["banana","orange","lemon"];
                             var citrus = fruits.slice(1)

2) splicing an array - This method is used to be add new items to an array.
                       var fruits = ["banana","orange","apple","mango"];
                       fruits.splice(2,0,"lemon","kiwi");

3)Unshift method - The unshift method returns the new array length .
                   Eg - var fruits = ["banana","orange","apple","mango"];
                   fruits.unshift("lemon"); //
                   returns 5  

4)Shift method - This method is remove the first array element and shifts all other elements to a lower index.
                 eg-  var fruits =["banana","orange","apple","mango"];
                      fruits.shift();   //
